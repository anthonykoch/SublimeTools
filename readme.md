# SublimeTools

Some reusable tools I use when writing sublime plugins.

## Utils.py

Contains helpers for executing shell commands, executing js files with node, getting views, and some other goodies.

## NodeEnv.py

Contains helpers for retrieving the path to the system wide installed node or nvm installed nvm. Currently untested on windows (but it's todo).
